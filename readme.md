Let me explain in more detail how **Python**, along with libraries like **Flask**, **Requests**, and **BeautifulSoup**, is able to **scrape data** from a website.

### Key Concepts and Libraries Used

1. **Flask**:
   - **Flask** is a web framework in Python. It helps us create a simple web application (like a website or API).
   - With Flask, we can create web routes (pages) that the user can visit and interact with.
2. **Requests**:

   - **Requests** is a Python library that helps us send HTTP requests. It's used to fetch data from a website.
   - When you want to get information from a website, you send an HTTP request to that website. The website then sends back a response containing the webpage's HTML content.
   - In this code, the `requests.get(url)` function is used to send the HTTP request and get the page's content.

3. **BeautifulSoup**:
   - **BeautifulSoup** is a Python library used for parsing and extracting useful information from HTML or XML.
   - Web pages are written in **HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language). HTML structures the content on a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, etc.
   - **BeautifulSoup** helps us "navigate" through this HTML structure and extract the pieces of content we are interested in (like all the text inside `<h3>` tags).

### Detailed Process

Here‚Äôs how **Python** scrapes data from a webpage step-by-step:

### 1. User Input (Form Data)

When the user opens the web page, they are presented with a **form** that asks for:

- The **URL** of the webpage they want to scrape (e.g., `https://www.punjabkesari.in/`)
- The **HTML tag** they want to search for (e.g., `<h3>`, which usually contains headlines or news titles).

### 2. Sending the HTTP Request

Once the user submits the form:

- The app receives the **URL** and **HTML tag** from the form (via `request.form.get()`).
- It then sends an HTTP **GET request** to the URL provided by the user using **`requests.get(url)`**.

  ```python
  response = requests.get(url)
  ```

- **`requests.get()`** sends a request to the website and gets back the full HTML content of that page. This is like opening the page in a browser, but we do it programmatically.

### 3. Parsing the HTML with BeautifulSoup

Now that we have the HTML content from the website, we need to **parse** it and find the data we want (like the content of `<h3>` tags).

- We use **BeautifulSoup** to parse the HTML:

  ```python
  soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")
  ```

- **`BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")`** takes the raw HTML data and converts it into a format that we can easily navigate and extract information from.

### 4. Extracting Data from the HTML üòä

Once the HTML is parsed, we want to find the **HTML tags** that the user specified (like `<h3>` tags).

- **`soup.find_all(tag)`** is used to search through the parsed HTML and find all instances of the specified tag.

  - For example, if the user chose the `<h3>` tag, this function will find every `<h3>` tag in the page.

  ```python
  elements = soup.find_all(tag)
  ```

- This will return a **list** of all `<h3>` elements in the HTML. Each element is a tag that contains the text or data we want to extract.

### 5. Extracting Text from the HTML Tags

Now that we have the `<h3>` tags, we want to get just the **text** inside these tags (i.e., the headlines).

- For each element found, we use **`element.get_text()`** to extract only the text, without the HTML tags.

  ```python
  elements = [element.get_text() for element in soup.find_all(tag)]
  ```

- This will create a **list of text strings**, one for each `<h3>` tag.

### 6. Displaying the Data

Finally, the app sends the extracted data to an HTML template (the result page) to display it to the user.

- **`render_template()`** is used to pass the extracted title, URL, and the scraped elements to the HTML page.
  ```python
  return render_template("result.html", title=title, elements=elements, tag=tag, url=url)
  ```

### Example with `https://www.punjabkesari.in/` and `<h3>` Tag

Let's break down what happens when you provide the URL `https://www.punjabkesari.in/` and the tag `<h3>`:

1. The app sends a **GET request** to the website:

   - This fetches the HTML content of `https://www.punjabkesari.in/`.

2. The HTML content is parsed using **BeautifulSoup**.

3. It looks for all **`<h3>`** tags in the HTML, which typically contain the headlines or titles of news articles.

4. The **text inside each `<h3>`** tag is extracted and stored in a list.

5. Finally, the extracted headlines are displayed on the result page.

### Visualizing the Process

1. **User Input**:

   - URL: `https://www.punjabkesari.in/`
   - Tag: `<h3>`

2. **Request**:

   - Python sends an HTTP request to the website to fetch the content.

3. **Parsing HTML**:

   - BeautifulSoup reads and converts the HTML into a navigable structure.

4. **Finding and Extracting**:

   - Python finds all `<h3>` tags and extracts the text inside each tag.

5. **Displaying**:
   - The app displays the extracted text (news headlines) on a webpage.

### Result Output:

For the example of `https://www.punjabkesari.in/` and the `<h3>` tag, you might get an output like this (with the actual headlines from the site):

### Conclusion

This is the basic flow of how Python is doing the web scraping:

1. **Fetching** the webpage content.
2. **Parsing** the HTML to make it easier to work with.
3. **Searching** for the specified tags (like `<h3>`).
4. **Extracting** and cleaning up the text from those tags.
5. **Displaying** the scraped results.
